        <p>
          Personal trainers create customized workout plans for small groups or one-on-one clients. They provide physical and mental guidance, assess their clients’ bodily strengths and weaknesses, and help them reach their fitness goals. To excel at this job, having knowledge of different fitness methods and nutrition plans, and being an excellent communicator is a must. Having a bachelor’s degree isn’t necessary, but most employers require their trainers to hold a personal trainer certification.
